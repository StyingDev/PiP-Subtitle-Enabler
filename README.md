# 🖼️ Firefox PiP Subtitle Enabler

A simple Firefox extension that forces all `<video>` elements to activate their soft subtitles (`<track>` elements), ensuring they're visible in Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode - **if the browser and site support it**.


## 🔧 Why This Might Help

Firefox **does** support displaying subtitles in PiP, but only if:
- The subtitles are part of the native `<track>` element (WebVTT format).
- The `mode` of the track is set to `"showing"` **before** PiP is activated.

Most sites don’t default to `'showing'`, so this extension ensures subtitles are active and ready for PiP use.
